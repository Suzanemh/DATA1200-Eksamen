        <h2>What is Accessibility Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is changing the way we live, but it needs to change how we access it, especially in the digital
            age that provides innovation and new opportunities to everyone who consumes it. It requires a lot of effort
            in creating a technology that can be used by ‘everyone’.

            Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the application
            being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other
            disadvantaged groups.

        <ul>
            <li>Cater to market for Disabled People</li>

            <li>Abide by Accessibility Legislations</li>
            <li>Avoid Potential Law Suits</li>


        </ul>
        <p>
            More information about these reasons can be found <a

        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are great benefits to accessibility testing. Among other things, that (1) Increases the
            website usage and market share, (2) Enhances the brand image, and (3) Makes the website accessible to
            society.
