        <h2>What is Accessibility Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is changing the way we live, but it needs to change how we access it, especially in the digital
            age that provides innovation and new opportunities to everyone who consumes it. It requires a lot of effort
            in creating a technology that can be used by ‘everyone’.

            Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the application
            being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other
            disadvantaged groups (Hamilton, 2021; TestingXperts, 2021)

        <h2>Why Accessibility Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            There are several reasons to test accessibility. Some of the reasons are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cater to market for Disabled People</li>

            <li>Abide by Accessibility Legislations</li>
            <li>Avoid Potential Law Suits</li>


        </ul>
        <p>
            More information about these reasons can be found <a
                href="https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/Why-Accessibility-Testing-is-Important#The%20Need%20For%20Accessibility%20Testing">
                at testingxperts blogs post. </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are great benefits to accessibility testing. Among other things, that (1) Increases the
            website usage and market share, (2) Enhances the brand image, and (3) Makes the website accessible to
            society (TestingXperts, 2021)
        </p>

        <h2>How to do Accessibility Testing, and which tools can we use?</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we will present how this website was designed, with accessibility as the main focus. The
            structure of this section is (1) presentation of design and implementation that contributes to universal
            design and (2) examples of its use.
        </p>




        <h3>Navigation bar</h3>
        <p>Navigation is the way users find and traverse the different pages available on your site. For this reason, it
            is imperative that navigation is accessible. By their nature, links are tab-able and all keyboard users and
            screen readers will read them–so, if your navigation is coded with links, a screen reader should find them
            (STVDIO, 2021).
        </p>

                alt="Navigation is the way users find and traverse the different pages available on your site." />
            <figcaption>Figure x. HTML code example of the use of navigation links</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <h3>Use of heading and paragraph tags</h3>
        <p>Web pages must be readable by electronic “screen readers” — which are devices commonly used by the visually
            impaired to surf the internet (Smith, 2018). Screen readers use heading tagsto navigate and prioritize the
            content. The strategic use of heading tags will not only make
            the site more easily manageable by screen readers but it will also make it more optimized for search
            engines (Smith, 2018). Therefor, it is important that there is a connection between the heading and the
            paragraph tag, so the website is more likely to be universally designed.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure x. Use of heading tags in this website</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Use ALT text for images</h3>
        <p>Screen readers can also read the text in the ALT tags in embedded image files. These tags usually contain a
            description of any images, infographics, or other non-text information on the page. The more descriptive
            the image, the better for the user (Smith, 2018).</p>

            <figcaption>Figure x. Example of using ALT text on image on this website</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <h3>Use of descriptive links</h3>
        <p>It’s important for link text to make sense without the surrounding sentences or content. The link text
            alone should convey the function and purpose of the link. Link text should also be unique and easy to speak
            out
            loud (Yale University, 2021). In that case, Avoid link text like “Click Here,” “More,” and “Read More.”
            These kinds of links can be confusing when a screen reader reads them out of context. </p>

        <h3>Text spacing</h3>
        <p>The text spacing must be able to be overridden to make the text easier to read. The requirement is
            specifically intended to meet (1) people with impaired vision, and (2) people with dyslexia
            (uutilsynet,
            2021).</p>
