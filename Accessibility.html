        <h2> What is Accessibility Testing?</h2>

        <p class="center-accessibility">
            Technology is changing the way we live, but it needs to change how we access it, especially
            in the
            digital
            age that provides innovation and new opportunities to everyone who consumes it. It requires
            a lot of
            effort
            in creating a technology that can be used by ‘everyone’.

            Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the
            application
            being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age
            and other
            disadvantaged groups (Hamilton, 2021; TestingXperts, 2021).

        <h2>Why Accessibility Testing?</h2>

        <p class="center-accessibility">
            There are several reasons to test accessibility. Some of the reasons are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <div class="center-accessibility">
                <li>Cater to market for Disabled People</li>
                <li>Abide by Accessibility Legislations</li>
                <li>Avoid Potential Law Suits</li>
            </div>
        </ul>

        <p class="center-accessibility">
            More information about these reasons can be found <a

        <div class="container-accessibility">
            <div class="text-accessibility">
                <p>
                    Furthermore, there are great benefits to accessibility testing. Among other things, that
                    <strong>(1)</strong>Increases the
                    website usage and market share, <strong>(2)</strong> Enhances the brand image, and
                    <strong>(3)</strong> Makes the website
                    accessible to
                    society (TestingXperts, 2021).

        <h2>How to do Accessibility Testing, and which tools can we use?</h2>
        <p class="center-accessibility">
            In this section, we will present how this website was designed, with accessibility as the main
            focus.
            The
            structure of this section is <strong>(1)</strong> presentation of design and implementation that contributes
            to
            universal
            design and <strong>(2)</strong> examples of its use.

        <h3>Navigation bar</h3>


        <div class="container-accessibility">

                <code class="language-html">

                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/nav&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>


            <div class="text-accessibility">
                <p>Navigation is the way users find and traverse the different pages
                    available on your site. For
                    this reason, it is imperative that navigation is accessible.
                    The "skip to content-link" makes our website more accessible for blind users.
                    The link allows users who navigate with keyboard or screen readers to easily
                    skip to the main content without having to go through the header and
                    navigation-menu every time (W3Schools, n.d.).
                    By their nature, links are tab-able and all keyboard users
                    and screen readers will read them–so, if your navigation is coded
                    with links (see the code to left), a screen reader
                    should find when tabbing through the navigation list
                    (STVDIO, 2021). The code on the left is inspired by Rascia (2016) which highlight code syntax in a
                    website rather than adding a screenshot. This allows screen readers to read the entire
                    code.

        <h3>Use of heading and paragraph tags</h3>
        <div class="container-accessibility">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-html">
                    &lt;h1&gt;Reflection of accessibility testing&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;h2&gt; What is Accessibility Testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
                    &lt;h2&gt;Why Accessibility Testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <div class="text-accessibility">
                <p>Web pages must be readable by electronic “screen readers” — which are devices commonly used
                    by
                    the
                    visually
                    impaired to surf the internet (Smith, 2018). Screen readers use heading tagsto navigate and
                    prioritize
                    the
                    content. The strategic use of heading tags will not only make
                    the site more easily manageable by screen readers but it will also make it more optimized
                    for
                    search
                    engines (Smith, 2018). Therefor, it is important that there is a connection between the
                    heading
                    and the
                    paragraph tag, so the website is more likely to be universally designed.</p>
            </div>
        </div>



        <h3>Use ALT text for images</h3>
        <div class="container-accessibility">

            <pre>
                <code class="language-html">
                    alt=&quot;What to avoid when referring to a link.&quot;
                    alt=&quot;Use of descriptive link text&quot;
                    
                </code>
            </pre>


            <div class="text-accessibility">
                <p>Screen readers can also read the text in the ALT tags in embedded image files. These tags usually
                    contain a
                    description of any images, infographics, or other non-text information on the page. The more
                    descriptive
                    the image, the better for the user (Smith, 2018).</p>
            </div>

        </div>



        <h3>Use of descriptive links</h3>

        <p class="center-accessibility">It’s important for link text to make sense without the surrounding sentences or
            content. The
            link
            text
            alone should convey the function and purpose of the link. Link text should also be unique and
            easy to
            speak
            out
            loud (Yale University, 2021). In that case, Avoid link text like “Click Here,” “More,” and “Read
            More.”
            These kinds of links can be confusing when a screen reader reads them out of context. In our website, we
            provided this by giving a descriptive link.
            Example of this is when we refer a link by writing: <br> <i>"More information about these reasons can be
                found at testingxperts blogs post."</i> </p>

        <h3>Avoid parallax effects</h3>
        <p class="center-accessibility">A parallax effect is a design trend where background elements move at speeds
            other than
            foreground elements
            as they scroll. We first wanted to use this effect in the homepage, but after reading our advice for
            designing websites, we dropped the effect. Because this type of movement is harmful to people with
            vestibular disorders and should be avoided or used with
            extreme caution and restraint (WCAG, 2021).</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Color contrast</h3>

    <div class="container-accessibility">
        <div class="text-accessibility">
            <p>Contrast and color use are vital to accessibility. Users, including users with visual disabilities,
                must be able to perceive content on the page (WebAIM, 2021). In that case, we used an automated test
                to check the contrast color of the website. The contrast ratio was X. Moreover, the values of
                <strong>normal text</strong>, <strong>large text</strong> and <strong>graphical objects and user
                    interface components</strong> is passed, see figure 3.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-accessibility">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/Contrast.png"
                    alt="The test result after checking the color contrast using an automated test."
                    title="Color contrast automated test result." />

    <h3>AChecker web accessibility checker</h3>

    <div class="container-accessibility testing">
        <div class="full-width">
            <p>We used another automated tool named "AChecker". This time, we set the options to <strong>Enable
                    HTML, CSS and show sources validator</strong>. We also used both <strong> 2.0 (Level AA and
                    AAA)</strong>.
                The test results after checking was "Congratulations! No known problems", see figure 4.
