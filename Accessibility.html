<!--Accessibility page: 
    It must contain a short presentation of accessibility
(up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
accessibility using an automated test. 

Also explain how you checked,
validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the
testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of
your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we

        <h2>What is Accessibility Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is changing the way we live, but it needs to change how we access it, especially in the digital
            age that provides innovation and new opportunities to everyone who consumes it. It requires a lot of effort
            in creating a technology that can be used by ‘everyone’.

            Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the application
            being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other
            disadvantaged groups (Hamilton, 2021; TestingXperts, 2021)

        <h2>Why Accessibility Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            There are several reasons to test accessibility. Some of the reasons are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cater to market for Disabled People</li>

            <li>Abide by Accessibility Legislations</li>
            <li>Avoid Potential Law Suits</li>


        </ul>
        <p>
            More information about these reasons can be found <a
                href="https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/Why-Accessibility-Testing-is-Important#The%20Need%20For%20Accessibility%20Testing">at
                testingxperts blogs post.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are great benefits to accessibility testing. Among other things, that (1) Increases the
            website usage and market share, (2) Enhances the brand image, and (3) Makes the website accessible to
            society (TestingXperts, 2021)

        <h2>How to do Accessibility Testing, and which tools can we use?</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we will present how this website was designed, with accessibility as the main focus. The
            structure of this section is (1) presentation of design and implementation that contributes to universal
            design and (2) examples of its use.
