        <h1>How to tackle the problem of mis- and disinformation on the internet</h1>
        <p>
            On the internet, <b>anyone</b> can share information, and therefore, as an individual, we should be more
            skeptical of the information we
            read by being <a href="https://libguides.lub.lu.se/c.php?g=296902&p=1988023" target="_blank">source
                critical</a>. Not believing everything you
            read is the first step to reducing this problem. Many articles have <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait" target="_blank">clickbait titles</a>
            that are misleading with the intention to make people curious and in that way earn money. The title often
            gives <a href="https://www.webwise.ie/teachers/what-is-fake-news/" target="_blank">false information</a>
            while the rest of the texts give the correct information.
            Reading the whole text is therefore important.


            Given that everybody with an <a href="https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview"
                target="_blank">internet connection</a> can potentially <a
                href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zcr8r2p" target="_blank">spread fake news</a>, one of
            the important things you as an individual can do to prevent spread of mis- and disinformation,
            is to always be <a
                href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/austincc-learningframeworks/chapter/chapter-7-critical-thinking-and-evaluating-information/"
                target="_blank">critical of the information</a> you read and hear yourself, so you don’t contribute
            to the spread. Even though the information seems legit, you should always check several sources before
            spreading it further yourself. If you’re doubtful, check with a site like
            <a href="https://www.snopes.com/" target="_blank">www.Snopes.com</a> or <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/"
                target="_blank">www.factcheck.org</a> (Kiely, E. 2016).
            One thing you can actively do is to call out people in for example <a
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation"
                target="_blank">comment sections</a> that are spreading fake news. A lot of these people
            are just saying things to provoke and start a fight, so you calling them out is maybe what they actually
            want to happen. In these cases, it's better to just report them so that a moderator can
            remove their comment and possibly block them from commenting bullshit on things in the future.

            Even though newspapers should be <a href="https://guides.libs.uga.edu/reliability" target="_blank">reliable
                sources</a>, they are not always. They can spread
            <a href="https://www.sikkerhverdag.no/en/being-prepared/warning-and-information/how-to-recognise-fake-news/"
                target="_blank">fake news</a> because somebody has set them up to fool them, or they can have posts from
            opinionated people that are not supposed to be factual (reader posts), but not everybody will understand
            that this is not pure facts.
