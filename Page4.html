            <h1>What can you do as an individual to help tackle the problem of mis- and disinformation
                on the internet, both in terms of your personal and your professional life?</h1>
            <p>
                On the internet, anyone can share information, and therefore, as an individual, we should be
                more skeptical of the information we read by being source critical (LINK). Not believing everything
                you read is the first step to reducing this problem. Many articles have clickbait titles that are
                misleading (LINK) with the intention to make people curious and in that way earn money. The title
                often gives false information (LINK), while the rest of the texts give the correct information. Reading
                the whole text is therefore important.
                Given that everybody with an internet connection can potentially spread fake news, one of
                the important things you as an individual can do to prevent spread of mis- and disinformation,
                is to always be critical of the information you read and hear yourself, so you don’t contribute
                to the spread. Even though the information seems legit, you should always check several
                sources before spreading it further yourself. If you’re doubtful, check with a site like
                Snopes.com or factcheck.org (Kiely, E. 2016). One thing you can actively do is to call out
                people in for example comment sections that are spreading fake news. A lot of these people
                are just saying things to provoke and start a fight, so you calling them out is maybe what they
                actually want to happen. In these cases, it's better to just report them so that a moderator can
                remove their comment and possibly block them from commenting bullshit on things in the
                future.
                Even though newspapers should be reliable sources, they are not always. They can spread
                fake news because somebody has set them up to fool them, or they can have posts from
                opinionated people that are not supposed to be factual (leserinnlegg), but not everybody will
                understand that this is not pure facts.
